# Detectify : Image Tampering Detection using Error Level Analysis (ELA) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
 The Image Tampering Detection project utilizes Error Level Analysis (ELA) to highlight compression differences and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for robust classification of tampered and authentic regions. By integrating ELA with CNNs, the system accurately identifies and localizes tampered areas within digital images.
